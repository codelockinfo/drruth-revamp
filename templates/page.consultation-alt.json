She was able see what their challenges were and restore balance to all of my animals as well as myself. Everything she said made perfect sense. During the session all of them were calmer than usual and the results are incredible! They are all much more relaxed as well as wanting to walk longer, 2 of them are over 10 years old and back to acting like younger animals while outside running and playing with each other. As for my experience after the session, I've been feeling much calmer yet energetic and centered. Thank you, Laura, for all you do and your perfect love for all animals. Much appreciated. I will be connecting again. I highly recommend Laura! We will book Laura again! <\/p>",
